# üìò SonarQube Quality Gates ‚Äì Project-wise Guidelines  

## 1. Introduction  
SonarQube Quality Gates act as **control points** to ensure software quality before moving to production. They help organizations maintain a balance between **speed of delivery** and **code quality standards**, ensuring that no critical issues slip into live systems.  

---

## 2. What is the Need for Quality Gates?  
Quality Gates are needed because:  
- They **prevent high-risk issues** like vulnerabilities and bugs from reaching production.  
- They help manage **technical debt** by enforcing consistent improvement in new code.  
- They ensure **compliance** with industry standards and regulations.  
- They provide **confidence to stakeholders** that the software delivered meets minimum quality standards.

## 3. Why Do We Need Project-Specific Quality Gates?  
Each project has unique needs, so the gates must be customized instead of using one-size-fits-all rules.
- **Alignment with business priorities** (e.g., stricter for finance, flexible for internal tools).  
- **Practical thresholds** that encourage progress without blocking teams.  
- **Incremental improvement** in legacy-heavy systems by focusing only on new code quality.  
- **Better governance**, since each project is evaluated based on its purpose and risk profile.
  
  Examples
  - A **banking app** needs very strong **security checks**.  
  - An **internal tool** may focus more on **maintainability and speed**.  
  - A **healthcare app** must ensure **data safety and compliance**.

## 4. What to Consider When Defining Quality Gates?
When creating gates, think about these factors:

- **Domain / Industry Needs**  
  Example: A banking app must prioritize security rules like preventing SQL Injection.  

- **Business Risk**  
  If the project handles customer money or health data, focus more on vulnerabilities.  

- **Team Skills & Maturity**  
  If the team is new, start with simpler rules (bugs + coverage). Over time, add stricter rules.  

- **Project Type**  
  - APIs ‚Üí reliability, performance, security.  
  - Frontend apps ‚Üí usability, maintainability, code duplication.  
  - Data pipelines ‚Üí performance, error handling, scalability.

## 5. Example for Better Understanding

### Banking / Financial Applications  
These projects demand **extremely high security and reliability** because they handle sensitive financial data and real-time transactions. The priority is eliminating vulnerabilities and ensuring strict compliance with financial regulations.  

### Healthcare Applications  
These systems work with **patient health records** and must comply with privacy regulations such as HIPAA. The focus is on data confidentiality, reliability, and ensuring that no sensitive data is exposed through insecure code.  

### E-commerce / Retail Applications  
These applications deal with **customer data and payments**, but the main driver is scalability and reliability. The focus is on securing payment modules, maintaining stable performance, and preventing issues that can affect user experience.  

### Government / Public Sector Applications  
Public sector projects typically manage **citizen data** and require strict compliance with GDPR or ISO standards. Reliability, security, and auditability are top priorities to maintain public trust.  

### Startup / MVP Projects  
In early-stage projects, the main priority is **speed of delivery**. However, security still cannot be compromised. The focus is on allowing flexibility while ensuring that no critical vulnerabilities reach production.  

### Internal Tools  
Internal dashboards or reporting systems are not exposed externally and carry lower business risk. Here, the goal is to maintain maintainability and prevent long-term technical debt without overburdening the team.  

### Shared Libraries / SDKs  
Shared components are reused across multiple systems. If they are faulty, the impact spreads widely. The priority is to enforce **higher standards of reliability, maintainability, and test coverage** to ensure long-term stability.  

**Banking Application Example**  
- High priority: **Security checks** (no vulnerabilities, no leaked secrets, no SQL injections).  
- Medium priority: **Code coverage** (tests for all money-related functions).  
- Low priority: **Code smells** (naming issues, formatting), since business risk is smaller.

## 6. How Should Teams Approach Gate Definition?  
- Start with a **base gate** that ensures no critical bugs or vulnerabilities.  
- Adjust thresholds based on **domain, compliance, and criticality**.  
- Use a **new code strategy**, focusing on recently added or modified code.  
- Review and **evolve the gates regularly** as projects mature and business needs change.  
- Ensure gates are **integrated with CI/CD pipelines**, making quality checks part of the delivery flow.  

Custom gates make sure the **right quality checks** are applied to the **right project**.
